#Description
In this project I learned a bit about JS and how to connect it with HTML and CSS.
</br>
This project also opened my mind more about transforming in CSS.
</br>
#How To Run
After loading you would run your mouse cursor across the screen and watch the eyes 
</br>
follow your movments around the screen.
</br>
#Roadmap
I plan on adding more styles to this project and also using the technique in other projects
</br>
that I would like to be interactive.
