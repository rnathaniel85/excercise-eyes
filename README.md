#Eyes Excercise
##Description
In this project I learned a bit about JS and how to connect it with HTML and CSS.
This project also opened my mind more about transforming in CSS.
<img src= "eyesThumbnail.png" width= '300px' />
###How To Run
After loading you would run your mouse cursor across the screen and watch the eyes 
follow your movments around the screen.
####Roadmap
I plan on adding more styles to this project and also using the technique in other projects
that I would like to be interactive.
